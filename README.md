# WeatherPy

**Target**: 
1. Develop a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator; 
2. Create a dashboard website to visualize the data and analysis results.

**Data**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

**Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS

**Libraries**: [citipy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), pandas, matplotlib, requests

**Notebook**: [Jupyter Notebook](WeatherPy.ipynb)

### Dashboard: https://michelle39140.github.io/WeatherPy/
* A [landing page](#index.html) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](Visualizations), each with:
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#Dashboard/Comparisons.html) that:
